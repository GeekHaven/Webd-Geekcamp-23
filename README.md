## Make `username.json` file ðŸ“£

**Make `username.json` (where `username` is your GitHub username) and then fill the information as given below and please maintain the following format** :

```
 {
       "name" : "Your Name",
       "username" : "your-github-username",
       "roll number" : "IIT2021xxx",
       "task 1":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       },
       "task 2":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       },
       "task 3":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       },
       "task 4":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       },
       "task 5":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       },
       "task 6":{
          "repo link" : "https://github.com/repo-name"
       }
    }
```

where `name` is your name,
`username` is your GitHub username,
`roll number` is your official IIITA roll number,
`repo link` is the link of repository

For example, see `Manas2403.json`(where Manas2403 is GitHub username).
